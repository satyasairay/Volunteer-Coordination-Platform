## 🐛 CRITICAL BUG FIXED: Field Worker Form Submission

### The Problem
**Error**: "❌ Network error. Please try again." when submitting Add Field Worker form  
**Impact**: Complete system failure for field worker submissions  
**Root Cause**: Database type mismatch (INTEGER vs VARCHAR) in village_id lookup

### The Solution
✅ **Robust Input Validation**: Added proper village_id validation with type checking  
✅ **Clear Error Messages**: Users get helpful feedback if selection is invalid  
✅ **Type Safety**: Converts string to integer before database query  
✅ **Graceful Handling**: Rejects new village creation with clear instructions

### Technical Details
**File**: `main.py` (lines 1660-1683, 1721)

**Key Changes**:
1. Extract and validate `village_id` from form data
2. Check if empty → Return error "Village selection is required"
3. Try converting to integer → If successful, query database
4. If conversion fails → It's a new village name → Reject with message about admin approval
5. Use validated `village_id` variable when creating FieldWorker record

**Before**: Crashed with database type error  
**After**: Clean validation with helpful user feedback
