**Status:** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**  
**Date:** October 29, 2025  
**Implementation Time:** ~30 minutes  

---

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### Backend API Endpoints (5 New Routes)

#### 1. **POST /api/admin/users** - Create New Admin
**Purpose:** Super admins can create new admin users without registration flow

**Features:**
- ✅ Creates super_admin or block_coordinator
- ✅ Email uniqueness validation
- ✅ Password strength check (min 8 chars)
- ✅ Auto-activates admin-created users
- ✅ Requires primary_block for coordinators
- ✅ Records who created the admin

**Request:**
```
POST /api/admin/users
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

full_name=John Doe
email=john@example.com
password=SecurePass123
role=super_admin OR block_coordinator
primary_block=Bhadrak (if coordinator)
assigned_blocks=Bhadrak,Tihidi (optional)
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Admin user created successfully",
  "user": {
    "id": 123,
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "full_name": "John Doe",
    "role": "super_admin",
    "primary_block": "",
    "is_active": true
  }
}
```

**Security:**
- ✅ Only super_admin can access
- ✅ Validates role is super_admin or block_coordinator
- ✅ Checks email uniqueness
- ✅ Enforces password minimum length

---

#### 2. **PUT /api/admin/users/{user_id}/role** - Change User Role
**Purpose:** Promote coordinators to super_admin or demote super_admin to coordinator

**Features:**
- ✅ Change between super_admin ↔ block_coordinator
- ✅ Prevents demoting last super admin
- ✅ Updates block assignments when role changes
- ✅ Only super admins can use this

**Request:**
```
PUT /api/admin/users/5/role
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

new_role=super_admin OR block_coordinator
primary_block=Bhadrak (if coordinator)
assigned_blocks=Bhadrak,Tihidi (if coordinator)
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Role changed to super_admin successfully",
  "user": {
    "id": 5,
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "role": "super_admin",
    "primary_block": "",
    "assigned_blocks": ""
  }
}
```

**Safety Rules:**
- ✅ Cannot demote if only 1 active super admin remains
- ✅ Counts active super admins before allowing change
- ✅ Clears block assignments when promoting to super_admin

---

#### 3. **DELETE /api/admin/users/{user_id}** - Delete User
**Purpose:** Permanently remove user (dangerous - use with caution)

**Features:**
- ✅ Hard delete from database
- ✅ Prevents deleting last super admin
- ✅ Only super admins can delete

**Request:**
```
DELETE /api/admin/users/5
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "User deleted successfully"
}
```

**Safety Rules:**
- ✅ Cannot delete if only 1 super admin remains
- ✅ No soft delete - permanent removal
- ⚠️ Use deactivate instead when possible

---

#### 4. **POST /api/admin/users/{user_id}/deactivate** (Already Existed)
**Purpose:** Disable user access without deletion

**Features:**
- ✅ Sets is_active = false
- ✅ User cannot login
- ✅ Data preserved

---

#### 5. **POST /api/admin/users/{user_id}/reactivate** (Already Existed)
**Purpose:** Re-enable deactivated user

**Features:**
- ✅ Sets is_active = true
- ✅ Clears rejection reason
- ✅ User can login again

---
